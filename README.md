# HelloPhoenix

## Requirements

Of course you will need Elixir, PostgreSQL and a bunch of other goodness installed. If you are on Mac OS X and have Homebrew installed, you can simply execute `./scripts/install_on_mac_os_x.sh` to install all hard requirements for this project except Node.js (which I am sure you already have, right? ;)).

## Start the app

To start your Phoenix app:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phoenix.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:8090`](http://localhost:8090) from your browser.
